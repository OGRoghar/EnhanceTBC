## Summary

Describe the feature you want in one or two sentences.

- Current behavior:
- Why this is a problem:

## Proposed Solution

Describe what you want EnhanceTBC to do.

- New option/setting name (if applicable):
- Where it should appear in `/etbc` config:

3. 

## Alternatives Considered

Describe any alternatives or workarounds you considered (other addons, macros, CVars, etc.).

## Scope / Constraints (Important)

Please note any constraints or preferences:

- TBC Anniversary client (`2.5.5`, interface `20505`) only? `Yes` / `No`
- Cross-client compatibility desired (Classic/Wrath/Cata variants)? `Yes` / `No`
- Must avoid taint/combat lockdown interactions? `Yes` / `No` / `Unknown`
- UI-only (visual) vs gameplay automation concern:
- Performance sensitivity (e.g. nameplates, combat log, frequent OnUpdate): `Low` / `Medium` / `High`

## Mockup / Reference (Optional)

Add screenshots, sketches, or links to Blizzard UI behavior / another addon for reference.

## Additional Context

Anything else that would help implement or evaluate the request:

- slash command expectations (`/etbc ...`)
- profile behavior (per-profile vs character-wide)
- interaction with existing modules/settings
- localization considerations (`deDE`, `frFR`, etc.)
